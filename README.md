# Battle-ship-with-C-language
Battle ship game made with c-language


Project description (04.02.2024)

The main reason for this game was to made game with c-language to show current state of my c-language skills. I chosed the Battle ship as a game because it sound little challenging for me. 

To be developed at future

The game was developed with windows command prompt output, but if I would have more time I would have used some kind of graphical library to display game with more style. In the future that kind of version will be done also. 

Computer AI will be updated to be harder. Currently it does some shooting calculations, but I think those can be updated a lot.
